# Cryptography Example Code

#### This is example code, and neither audited nor written for production purposes!

[HPKE](hpke.py) is an implementation of HPKE (draft-barnes-cfrg-hpke), written in Python such that the code (mostly) conforms closely to the pseudocode used in the draft.

[HPKE Demo](hpke-demo.py) is a sample usage of the above, written with the intent that some of the flows and PDUs expected in a real system are more obvious.
